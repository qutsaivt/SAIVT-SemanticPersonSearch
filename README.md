# **SAIVT Semantic Person Search Database**

## **Overview**

The SAIVT Semantic Person Search Database was developed to provide a suitable platform to develop and evaluate techniques that search for a person using a semantic query (i.e. tall, red shirt, jeans). Sequences for 110 subjects consisting of 30 initialisation frames (to, for instance, learn a background model), a number of annotated frames containing the target subject, and a description of the subject incorporating a number of traits including clothing type and colour, gender, height and build are provided.

At this point, you should have the following data structure and the SAIVT-SoftBioSearch database is installed:

Sequences for the individual subjects are contained within the directories named C[1..6]-[TorsoDescription]-[LegDescription]. There are 110 subjects captured from six different cameras. Each directory contains an XML file with the annotation for that sequence, and the images that belong to the sequence. For each sequence, the first 30 frames are reserved for updating/learning a background model, and as such have no annotation.

The 'Calibration' directory contains a camera calibration (using Tsai's method) for the six cameras used in the database.

The 'Data' directory contains additional data that may of use. In particular, it contains a collection of colour patches within 'Data/CultureColours' that can be used to train models for a specific colour. It also contains a set of patches for skin, and for non-skin colours. 'Data/Videos' contains videos for each camera, that can be used to learn the background. It should also be noted that for a portion of the time when the database was captured, a temporary wall was up due to construction works. This impacted the following sequences captured from cameras 1 and 6:
- Camera1 
  - C1-GreenWhiteHorizontal-BlackPants 
  - C1-RedCheck-BlackSkirt 
  - C1-GreenCheck-BrownPants
- Camera6 
  - C6-GreenFaceCover-Blue-Blue 
  - C6-YellowWhiteSpotDress

Additional videos for these cameras are also included and are named CamX_Wall.avi. The 'SAIVTSoftBioSearchDB.xml' file defines the database. This file specifies the cameras and their calibrations/background sequences, includes definitions for the traits/soft biometrics, and lists the sequences.
